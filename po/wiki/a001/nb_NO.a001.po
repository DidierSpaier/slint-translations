msgid "A BTRFS file system consists of a logical volume that can span multiple block devices (partitions or disks). Initially Slint is installed on a single partition."

msgid "A subvolume is a subtree of files inside the volume, the root of which can be mounted as if it were an independent filesystem. However, the space allocated to a volume is also allocated to each of its sub-volumes: it is therefore not necessary to distribute it between the sub-volumes, as if they were in distinct partitions."

On the other hand, the \"compress_zstd:3\" mount option means that all the files that will be stored will be compressed by the zstd utility with compression level 3. Thus the size of the system is approximately half that with the ext4 file system."

msgid "Another remarkable feature of BTRFS is \"copy-on-write\". When editing a file, modified parts are written to another location, the metadata (which record the location of all parts of the file) being updated. As long as the previous data are still referenced, they will stay untouched."

#. type: Plain text

msgid "This makes it very easy to create snapshots of BTRFS subvolume: taking a new snapshot is \"free\", as it uses very few disk space: only the metadata of the snapshot are written, which stores the physical location of all parts of files in the subvolume, and this is done almost instantly. The space used by the snapshot will only grow when the original subvolume and the snapshot differ, as then the snapshot will retrieves data removed from the original. On the other hand data added to the original will not be included in he snapshot: in other words a modification of the original subvolume does not modify the snapshot."
