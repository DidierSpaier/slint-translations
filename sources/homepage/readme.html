<h1 id="_about_slint">About Slint</h1>
<p>Slint is an easy-to-use, versatile, blind-friendly Linux distribution
for 64-bit computers. Slint is based on Slackware and borrows tools from
Salix. Maintainer: Didier Spaier.</p>
<h1 id="_features">Features</h1>
<ul>
<li><p>Slint is a stable distribution. However, accessibility software
is regularly updated, others may be updated on a case by case
basis.</p></li>
<li><p>The included software, among which the MATÃ‰ and LXQt desktops
(with XFCE installed on-demand), cover most needs. Many others are
available in repositories maintained by Salix and Slackware that are
fully compatible with Slint.</p></li>
<li><p>Slint can be used in console and graphical modes and can be
switched between these modes without restarting. It is even possible to
launch several graphical environments and switch between them.</p></li>
<li><p>Easy-to-use tools facilitate system administration and software
package management. Updates are fully automatic, under user
control.</p></li>
<li><p>By default, a compressed swap space in RAM allows doubling the
usable memory.</p></li>
<li><p>Slint can be installed on any 64-bit machine with at least 2G of
memory, and 30G available on any medium including USB keys, without
secure boot.</p></li>
<li><p>If installed on USB media Slint is portable from one computer to
another. The media can be fully encrypted.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="_installation">Installation</h1>
<p>The installation program, in text mode, is fully accessible for blind
people using a screen reader or Braille display, and proceeds by
questions and answers with online help and integrated documentation. Two
partitioning modes are available:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Manual: the user chooses the file system (btrfs, ext4 or xfs) and
the media can be shared with other systems.</p></li>
<li><p>Automatic: The file system is then btrfs and the media dedicated
to Slint.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The btrfs file system is configured with subvolumes instead of
separate partitions. It allows to divide by 2 the space occupied on the
media, to take snapshots and is well adapted to SSD, NVMe and USB
sticks.</p>
