To familiarize yourself with shell scripts' internationalization and
localization, use the Documentation menu entry. This is a must if you want
to develop, maintain or translate internationalized shell scripts.

Read Utilization to know each option's purpose and intended usage.

Abbreviations used in the menu are:
PO for Portable Object: catalog of human readable messages recording
   both the messages in the original language (usually English) and their
   translations in a given locale. There is one PO file per locale.
POT for Portable Object Template: template including only the messages in
   the original language, used to initialize the POs.
MO for Machine Object: compiled catalog of messages used by the 'gettext'
   program to translate "on the fly" messages displayed by the scripts in
   a given language. There should be one MO per locale, generated from the
   corresponding PO file

According to POSIX standard :
"A locale is the definition of the subset of a user's environment that
depends on language and cultural conventions."

In Linux a locale value takes the form:
[language[_territory][.codeset][@modifier]]

For practical reasons we will restrict us to following form:
language_territory, abbreviated in ll_TT, with codeset=utf8 (implicit).
