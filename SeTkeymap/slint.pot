"On the install disk, the first three consoles are login consoles.\n"
"The fourth console is used to show informational messages during\n"
"installation, such as disk formatting status, kernel messages, and\n"
"so on.\n"
"\n"
"A useful trick is to log into the second virtual console during the\n"

"full your hard drive is getting.  Also, once the Slint CD-ROM\n"
"has been mounted on /cdrom, most of the commands in the disc's live\n"
"filesystem will be usable.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"PARTITIONING YOUR DRIVE\n"
"\n"
"Now lets take a look at how you progress through a typical Linux\n"
"installation with the Slint distribution.  First, you'll have\n"
"to make sure your hard drive has been partitioned to accept Linux.\n"
"The setup program does not do this for you.\n"
"\n"
"You will need at least one type Linux partition, and optionally a\n"
"swap partition.  In my opinion, (if you have a fair amount of drive\n"
"space) it's easiest to manage a system that's partitioned along these\n"
"lines (ignoring any Windows or other partitions for the purposes\n"
"of this illustration):\n"
"\n"
"    [ 6 gig or more for / ] \n"
"    [ whatever space users need for /home ]\n"
"    [ swap space (match the size of your RAM) ]\n"
"\n"
"Some people like a separate partition for /usr/local, but I find that\n"
"I usually regret dividing my free space when I don't have to... the\n"
"partition I want to add to is always full that way. :^)  Besides, when\n"
"the time comes for an operating system upgrade you can always back up\n"
"/usr/local regardless of whether it occupies its own partition.  In\n"
"fact, having a separate /home partition is also optional.  Probably the\n"
"simplest way to approach things initially is with just a single root\n"
"Linux partition, and a swap partition of about 1-2 gigabytes.\n"
"\n"
"Partitioning is done with a partitioning tool such as fdisk.  There are\n"
"two versions of Linux fdisk available now.  'fdisk' is the standard\n"
"version, and 'cfdisk' is a friendlier full screen version.  Most\n"
"people will probably want to use 'cfdisk' now, unless they're used\n"
"to the older version (like me).  Either one will get the job done.\n"
"\n"
"Make sure you use Linux fdisk to tag partitions as type 83 (Linux, the\n"
"default) or type 82 (Linux swap) so the Slint setup program will \n"
"recognize them.  Use the 't' command for that, and 'w' to write out the\n"
"changes.\n"
"\n"
"If you prefer an easy to use graphical partitioning tool, you can make\n"
"all your Linux partitions directly from Linux 'cfdisk'.  Or you can\n"
"make them with the older 'fdisk' using the 'n' command to create a\n"
"partition and the 'w' command to write out the changes when you're done. \n"
"\n"
"By default, 'fdisk' and 'cfdisk' will partition the first hard drive in\n"
"your machine, which is /dev/sda.  To partition other drives, you'll\n"
"have to specify the drive to partition when you start 'cfdisk'.  For\n"
"example, to partition the second IDE drive:\n"
"\n"
"  # cfdisk /dev/sdb\n"
"\n"
"SWAP SPACE\n"
"\n"
"If your machine doesn't have much memory, you might have already\n"
"learned how to activate a swap partition just to make it this far.\n"
"Normally you won't need to format or activate your swap space by\n"
"hand, but if you're installing on a machine with low memory you will\n"
"need to format and activate a swap partition to be able to install. \n"
"Once you've made the partition with fdisk, you need to use 'mkswap'\n"
"on it, and then activate it with 'swapon'.  Checking the partition\n"
"table with 'fdisk -l', we see these lines:\n"
"\n"
"   Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System\n"
"/dev/sda8           16650       16898     2000061   82  Linux swap\n"
"\n"
"So, the command to format would be:\n"
"\n"
"  # mkswap /dev/sda8\n"
"  # sync\n"
"\n"
"And to activate it:\n"
"\n"
"  # swapon /dev/sda8\n"
"\n"
"RUNNING THE SETUP PROGRAM\n"

"____________________\n"
"\n"
"First, a little help on help.  Whenever you encounter a text\n"
"viewer like this during the installation, you can move around\n"
"with these commands:\n"
"\n"
"PGDN           - Move down one page\n"
"PGUP           - Move up one page\n"
"HOME           - Move to beginning of file\n"
"END            - Move to end of file\n"
"\n"
"Also, you're running a real multitasking operating system now, so\n"
"you're not confined to the installation program.  You can log into\n"
"other consoles and look around at any time without disturbing the\n"
"installation process.  To do this, you need to learn the commands\n"
"that control the Linux console.  You'll use these commands all the\n"
"time when you're logged into Linux.\n"
"\n"
"\"Virtual\" consoles and scrollback:\n"
"\n"
"Right now, the screen you're looking at is probably VIRTUAL CONSOLE\n"
"NUMBER ONE, (or /dev/tty1 in Linux-speak).  There are usually\n"
"several virtual consoles available.  When you log into the install\n"
"disk, there are four consoles.  To switch among them, use Alt-F1,\n"
"Alt-F2, Alt-F3, or Alt-F4 to select which of the four consoles you\n"
"wish to use.  While you're using a console, you get a small amount\n"
"of text scrollback buffer.  To scroll the console back, hold down\n"
"the right shift key and hit PageUp.  To scroll the console forward,\n"
"hit PageDown while holding the right shift key down.  This can be\n"
"especially useful for reading the boot messages, which can go by\n"
"too fast to read otherwise.\n"
"\n"
"On the install disk, the first three consoles are login consoles.\n"
"The fourth console is used to show informational messages during\n"
"installation, such as disk formatting status, kernel messages, and\n"
"so on.\n"
"\n"
"A useful trick is to log into the second virtual console during the\n"
"installation.  Then you can use commands such as 'df' to check how\n"
"full your hard drive is getting.  Also, once the Slint CD-ROM\n"
"has been mounted on /cdrom, most of the commands in the disc's live\n"
"filesystem will be usable.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"PARTITIONING YOUR DRIVE\n"
"\n"
"Now lets take a look at how you progress through a typical Linux\n"
"installation with the Slint distribution.  First, you'll have\n"
"to make sure your hard drive has been partitioned to accept Linux.\n"
"The setup program does not do this for you.\n"
"\n"
"You will need at least one type Linux partition, and optionally a\n"
"swap partition.  In my opinion, (if you have a fair amount of drive\n"
"space) it's easiest to manage a system that's partitioned along these\n"
"lines (ignoring any Windows or other partitions for the purposes\n"
"of this illustration):\n"
"\n"
"    [ 6 gig or more for / ] \n"
"    [ whatever space users need for /home ]\n"
"    [ swap space (match the size of your RAM) ]\n"
"\n"
"Some people like a separate partition for /usr/local, but I find that\n"
"I usually regret dividing my free space when I don't have to... the\n"
"partition I want to add to is always full that way. :^)  Besides, when\n"
"the time comes for an operating system upgrade you can always back up\n"
"/usr/local regardless of whether it occupies its own partition.  In\n"
"fact, having a separate /home partition is also optional.  Probably the\n"
"simplest way to approach things initially is with just a single root\n"
"Linux partition, and a swap partition of about 1-2 gigabytes.\n"
"\n"
"Partitioning is done with a partitioning tool such as fdisk.  There are\n"
"two versions of Linux fdisk available now.  'fdisk' is the standard\n"
"version, and 'cfdisk' is a friendlier full screen version.  Most\n"
"people will probably want to use 'cfdisk' now, unless they're used\n"
"to the older version (like me).  Either one will get the job done.\n"
"\n"
"Make sure you use Linux fdisk to tag partitions as type 83 (Linux, the\n"
"default) or type 82 (Linux swap) so the Slint setup program will \n"
"recognize them.  Use the 't' command for that, and 'w' to write out the\n"
"changes.\n"
"\n"
"If you prefer an easy to use graphical partitioning tool, you can make\n"
"all your Linux partitions directly from Linux 'cfdisk'.  Or you can\n"
"make them with the older 'fdisk' using the 'n' command to create a\n"
"partition and the 'w' command to write out the changes when you're done. \n"
"\n"
"By default, 'fdisk' and 'cfdisk' will partition the first hard drive in\n"
"your machine, which is /dev/sda.  To partition other drives, you'll\n"
"have to specify the drive to partition when you start 'cfdisk'.  For\n"
"example, to partition the second IDE drive:\n"
"\n"
"  # cfdisk /dev/sdb\n"
"\n"
"SWAP SPACE\n"
"\n"
"If your machine doesn't have much memory, you might have already\n"
"learned how to activate a swap partition just to make it this far.\n"
"Normally you won't need to format or activate your swap space by\n"
"hand, but if you're installing on a machine with low memory you will\n"
"need to format and activate a swap partition to be able to install. \n"
"Once you've made the partition with fdisk, you need to use 'mkswap'\n"
"on it, and then activate it with 'swapon'.  Checking the partition\n"
"table with 'fdisk -l', we see these lines:\n"
"\n"
"   Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System\n"
"/dev/sda8           16650       16898     2000061   82  Linux swap\n"
"\n"
"So, the command to format would be:\n"
"\n"
"  # mkswap /dev/sda8\n"
"  # sync\n"
"\n"
"And to activate it:\n"
"\n"
"  # swapon /dev/sda8\n"
"\n"
