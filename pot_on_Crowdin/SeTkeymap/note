The files <ll_TT>.slint.po have been copied from:
/storage/Traduction/Transifex/MYENV/slint/translations/slint.slint-14.2.1
downloaded from the slint project on Transifex
then converted to <ll_TT>.SeTkeymap.po running the script:
extract_SetKeymap.sh
Thre are only two text strings, already translated in 10 locales.
Currently it is not in Crowdin; is it worth putting it here to get more
translations? Or maybe rewrite it as in keyboardsetup from Salix?
